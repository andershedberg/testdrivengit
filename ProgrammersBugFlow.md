***Solving programming bugs***

**Working alone**

* Google is your friend - google "the 1223 error message text"
* Read Stack Overflow
* Explain to a rubber duck
* Read the source code ( of imported module )
* Read the documentation ( RTFM )
* Read the test cases ( if they exist )
* Check your mental model by changing anything to see if you get the expected result
* Step throught the code in the debugger
* Decompile the code
* Write small tests for the problematic module
* Write a very small program that reproduces the problem
* Divide and conquer - Take the problem apart and solve the small issues
* Test all the small parts 
* Insert print lines to follow what happens
* If a used module is not documented/maintained throw it away
* Use another lib or write your own
* Search relevant research when you have a bit of knowledge

**Asking questions**
* Prepare question for others
  * “What did you want to happen?”
  * “What actually happened? (Include any error details)”
  * “Paste the shortest block of code that reproduces the problem. (Well formated!)”
  * “Describe what you’ve tried so far (including searches, etc.)”
* Ask question on Stack Overflow ( never mind the Stack Elitism jerks )
* Ask on github forum for help
* Ask questions on Google business forums for Google maps
* Ask on Facebook in Kodapor
* Send an email to others that use this code and seems to have solved it
* Send an email message to the author of the code

**Involving others**
* Send a slack message to a colleauge for help
* Ask for help on the Standup Meeting
* Ask a senior person
* Walk through the problem with a colleauge
* Use a whiteboard to describe the flow
* Describe your mental model to a colleauge
* Know all admins and functionality owners so questions can be answered quickly.
* Pair programming
* Mob programming
* Assign the problem to another
* Bring in another member into the team
* Hire a consultant
* Visit conferences on the subject to get personal connections

**Take time of - Mental processes**
* Take a walk
* Take a shower
* Sleep on it
* Let it rest for a while ( day, week, month )
* Get some coffee

**Giving up**
* Choose another solution

**New code from start**
* Write the comments for all the small parts of the total solution first, before coding.
* Write the documentation first, then the tests and finally the code
* Use pen and paper to describe the flow before coding

**What destroys productivity**
*Bugs
*Meetings
*Interuptions
*Hard to read code
*Context switching
*Que time for blocking answers.  
```How would you like to be treated by your co-workers? Sticky notes. Kindness, considerations and respect. Need to learn this.
