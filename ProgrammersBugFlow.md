***Solving programming bugs***

**Working alone**

* Google is your friend - google "the 1223 error message text"
* Read Stack Overflow
* Explain to a rubber duck
* Read the source code ( of imported module, this is a great way to learn new stuff )
* Read the documentation ( RTFM )
* Read the test cases ( if they exist )
* Check your mental model by changing anything to see if you get the expected result
* Step through the code in the debugger
* Insert print lines to follow what happens
* Decompile the code
* Divide and conquer - Take the problem apart and solve the small issues
* Write small tests for the problematic module
* Write a very small program that reproduces the problem
* If a used module is not documented/maintained throw it away
* Use another lib or write your own
* Search relevant research when you have a bit of knowledge
* Visit conferences on the subject


**Asking questions**
* Prepare question for others
  * “What did you want to happen?”
  * “What actually happened? (Include any error details)”
  * “Paste the shortest block of code that reproduces the problem. (Well formatted!)”
  * “Describe what you’ve tried so far (including searches, etc.)”
* Ask question on Stack Overflow ( never mind the Stack Elitism jerks )
* Ask in the github forum for help
* Ask questions on Google business forums for Google maps
* Ask on Facebook in Kodapor
* Send an email to others that use this code and seems to have solved it
* Send an email message to the author of the code

**Involving others**
* Send a slack message to a colleague for help
* Ask for help on the Stand Up Meeting
* Ask a senior person ( Read though rules for not destroying someone else productivity )
* Walk through the problem with a colleague
* Use a white board to describe the flow
* Describe your mental model to a colleague
* Know all admins and functionality owners so questions can be answered quickly.
* Pair programming
* Mob programming

**Take time of - Mental processes**
* Take a walk
* Take a shower
* Sleep on it
* Let it rest for a while ( day, week, month )
* Get some coffee

**Giving up**
* Choose another solution
* Assign the problem to another
* Bring in another member into the team
* Hire a consultant
* Pay the open source code developer of a problematic module to fix it

**New code from start**
* Write the comments for all the small parts of the total solution first, before coding.
* Write the documentation first, then the tests and finally the code
* Use a pen and paper to describe the flow before coding

**What destroys productivity**
* Bugs
* Meetings
* Interruptions
* Context switching
* Hard to read code
* Que time waiting for blocking answers from other people
