* Google is your friend - google "the 1223 error message text"
* Read Stack Overflow
* Explain to a rubber duck
* Send a slack message to a colleauge for help
* Ask a senior colleague
* Ask for help on the Standup Meeting
* Read the source code
* Read the documentation ( RTFM )
* Read the test cases ( if they exist )
* Check your mental model by changing anything to see if you get the expected result
* Step throught the code in the debugger
* Understand how things work, not just import a library for the standard case.
* Decompile the code
* Write small tests for the problematic module
* Write a very small program that reproduces the problem
* Insert print lines to follow what happens
* Ask question on Stack Overflow ( never mind the Stack Elitism jerks )
  * “What did you want to happen?”
  * “What actually happened? (Include any error details)”
  * “Paste the shortest block of code that reproduces the problem. (We’ll format it!)”
  * “Describe what you’ve tried so far (including searches, etc.)”
* Ask on github forum for help
* Ask questions on Google business forums for Google maps
* Ask on Facebook in Kodapor ;-)
* Send an email to others that use this code and seems to have solved it
* Send an email message to the author of the code
* Visit conferences on the subject to get personal connections
* Choose another solution
* If a used module is not documented/maintained throw it away
* Use another lib or write your own
* Search relevant research when you have a bit of knowledge
* Bring in another member into the team
* Get a consultant


* Divide and conquer - Take the problem apart and solve the small issues
* Test all the small parts 

* Let it rest for a while ( day, week, month )
* Take a walk
* Sleep on it
* Take a shower

* Assign the problem to another
* Pair programming
* Mob programming
* Walk through the probklem with a colleauge
* Describe your mental model to a colleauge


* Write the comments for all the small parts of the total solution first, before coding.
* Write the documentation first, then the tests and finally the code
* Use pen and paper do describe the flow before coding
* Use a whiteboard to describe the flow

* Driving for questions
* Know all admins and functionality owners so questions can be answered quickly.
What destroys productivity? Bugs. Meetings. Hard to read code. Context switching. Que time for blocking answers. Interuptions. 
How would you like to be treated by your co-workers? Sticky notes. Kindness, considerations and respect. Needs to learn this. Coding dojo. Only the navigator allowed to talk. This is how the coding dojo works.
