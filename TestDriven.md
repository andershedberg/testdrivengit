# Excercise 1 - Learn the basics of TDD without any magic frameworks ( 1 hour )
Once these videos have been viewed. Start with Issue #1 practicing Test Driven Development and do issue 1, 2, etc. for one hour. 

# Exercise 2 - Try a unit test framework

After doing this practice, change the above code to use a real unit test framework, as an example for embedded C development, use Unity -  http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity 

# Excercise 3 - Move to an embedded target
Then for the real stuff on embedded C development, read on how to do this on the target and try it.
